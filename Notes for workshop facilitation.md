Notes for workshop facilitation
===============================

###Presentation

Introduction to design patterns is kept relatively short - one shouldn't need 
to become a pattern expert before we dive into extracing expert knowledge and
the salient features of a lab senario. 

We have the precious time of practitioners in the room - they don't need a
seminar on the life, works, and influence of Christopher Alexander.

The workshop is designed to step through various activities, and hopefully
at the end we will have arrived at enough raw material from which we can
build a proto-pattern. Emphasising the "forces" and uncovering recurring
design rationale and constraints that matter in practice is the main 
objective. These will later form a pragmatic vocabulary we can use to 
annotate other protocols.

Some of the activities ask similar questions - it is OK to repeat responses. 

Abstraction
-----
Merely abstracting and generalising a protocol is not necessarily a pattern.
But it helps.
Abstraction helps us focus on the critical feature(s) of entitites in the
contex. We then ask 'why this?' Generalisation makes the concepts transferable.

Some people really struggle with making abstractions. That's cool. 
We dont expect every person or group to fly through and make a pattern at the
end. It very much depends on the protocol selected, background knowledge,
individuals cognitive styles, caffination levels etc.. Encourage those who 
seem to be struggling or disheartend to act as an audience or reader so others
can test or improve the clarity of their explanations.



Protocol Pictionary
------
This exercise is ~5-10mins
Encourage abstract thinking, have fun.
Allow a few mins at the end - 
Help break the ice by having participants explain to thier group what their 
picture is, the essense of what their protcol does....

At this point, it may be obvious that some protocls are too large.
If so - 
For the next sections, have the particpants choose a subprotocol - 
a potetnially reusable chunk that they are familiary with.
eg. antibody selection for the task, rather than (animal>ab>section>histology>
analysis>....)



Analysis and Shared Experience
------
This exercise is ~15 solo, then a few more minutes collective thinking.
Here we aim to get at the context, think about the general type of 
problem the protocol is an answer to. We start with critial refelction
from those most familiar with the procedure.
