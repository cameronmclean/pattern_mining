Notes for workshop facilitation
===============================

It is important for both facilitator and participants to be clear about
what we are trying to achieve.


>We want to create a shared vocabulary to talk about and annotate lab protocols
>in a way that is intuitive, and supports the task of experimental design and 
>solving problems at the bench.

The workshop is all about thinking of the design of lab procedures, the ways we
do things, and the reasons for the ways we do things in a successful 
experiment.

##The Presentation (Workshop Guidance)

Introduction to design patterns is kept relatively short - one shouldn't need 
to become a pattern expert before we dive into extracing expert knowledge and
the salient features of a lab senario. 

We have the precious time of practitioners in the room - they don't need a
seminar on the life, works, and influence of Christopher Alexander.

The workshop is designed to step through various activities without too much
preamble, and hopefully at the end we will have arrived at enough raw material
from which we can build a proto-pattern. Emphasising the "forces" and 
uncovering recurring design rationale and constraints that matter in practice 
is the main objective. These will later form a pragmatic vocabulary we can use 
to annotate other protocols.

Some of the activities ask similar questions - it is OK to repeat responses. 

###Abstraction
Merely abstracting and generalising a protocol is not necessarily a pattern.
But it helps.
Abstraction helps us focus on the critical feature(s) of entitites in the
contex. We then ask 'why this?' Generalisation makes the concepts transferable.

Some people really struggle with making abstractions. That's cool. 
We dont expect every person or group to fly through and make a pattern at the
end. It very much depends on the protocol selected, background knowledge,
individuals cognitive styles, caffination levels etc.. Encourage those who 
seem to be struggling or disheartend to act as an audience or reader so others
can test or improve the clarity of their explanations.



###Protocol Pictionary
This exercise is ~5-10mins
Encourage abstract thinking, have fun.
Allow a few mins at the end - 
Help break the ice by having participants explain to thier group what their 
picture is, the essense of what their protcol does....

At this point, it may be obvious that some protocls are too large.
If so - 
For the next sections, have the particpants choose a subprotocol - 
a potentailly reusable chunk that they are familiary with.
eg. antibody selection for the task, rather than (animal>Ab>section>histology>
analysis>....)



###Analysis and Shared Experience
This exercise is ~15 solo, then a few more minutes collective thinking.
Here we aim to get at the context, think about the general type of 
problem the protocol is an answer to. We start with critial refelction
from those most familiar with the procedure. We aim to articualte at a 
higher level, the fucntional purpose of the protocol, and the context
around it. In discussion with other group members, who may also have experience
collect tips and tricks, and scenarions where this type of protocol can be
used.   



###Abstracting the 'whats' and 'whys'
Forces (why's) can be anything - social, technical, economic, physical
We want to enumerate all the 'forces' in the protcol. Some forces will 
repeatedly occur. Some 'forces' may be present, but not end up being part of 
the final pattern - of all the variables, only some will form the important 
subsystem. By using existing protocols, we are starting with positive examples.
It is also possible to find forces by starting with negative examples and ask
why it didnt work (what forces were not resolved). This is powerful, but it is
harder to find negative examples in the literature. 

For drawing icons, some cocnepts are nearly impossible. Google images for ideas
or nounproject for CC licensed pictograms is a good source for inspiration.
We dont want to spend too long on the pictorgrams though - time is limited,
and elucidating the concepts is more important. 



###Graphing the forces
The idea here is to try and express the general problem that the protocol 
solves as a network of forces, diagramatically. From the previous exercise
there are likely important variables that interact - i.e the need to completely
immobilise a live sample for imaging but also keep it alive and happy.

We want to try and sketch out here all the 'forces' involved in the procedure
and show which ones interact.

Our protocol solves a problem, the 'forces' are the things that shape the 
problem _and_ its solution. 

As with the previous section, nounproject and google images can be used to
inspire quick icon sketches.
