Pattern Mining Kit for Laboratory Experiments
=============================================

Methods and resources for uncovering design patterns for laboratory work.

...

Pattern mining resources presented here are intended to be utilised and run as a half day workshop.
Workshops involve groups of participants of about 3-5 per group, and proceed on the basis of critical reflection and interactive discussion.
Workshop outputs are captured on paper in the first instance, and later refined and added to the pattern website.
