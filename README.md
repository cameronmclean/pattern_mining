Pattern Mining Kit for Laboratory Experiments
=============================================

Methods and resources for uncovering design patterns for laboratory work.

...

Pattern mining resources presented here are intended to be utilised and run as a half day workshop.
Workshops involve groups of participants of about 3-5, and proceed on the basis of interactive discussion and reflection.
Workshop outputs are captured on paper in the first instance, and later refined and added to the pattern website.
