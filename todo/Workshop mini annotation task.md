Workshop mini annotation task
=============================

Proposed new step in pattern mining workshop.

The idea here is that immediately after we have arrived at some abstractions of
critical features, i.e a first pass at a mini pattern/subset and force mapping,
try and annotate some example papers or protocols. The things we want to 
test/evalute are multiple... How complete is our pattern, how easy it is to
annotate, how useful are the annotations...

----

- Estimate your level of experience or confidence with your pattern/procedure.

- How easy do participants find it to annotate or mark-up text overall?

- Are the instances of pattern scenarios / concrete specifications (i.e the
things we annotate) easy to identify in example papers?

- Are there significant parts of the procedure _stated_ in the publication 
but not covered by pattern concepts? (test % text coverage with annotation)

- If there are large un-annotated sections, what important concepts are 
missing? Go back and mine some more....

- If we tabulate just the annotated text, armed with the pattern and the table,
is there enough information to re-create the procedure?

- How useful is it to compare the annotated (extracted instances) across 
procedures/different papers?

- Are there pattern concepts that can not be found in the published procedures?
(are the pattern concepts maybe unnecessary, or does the publication fail to 
address them...)

- Overall, are there details not stated in the protocol that really should be?
e.g. Antibody cat#, time/temperatures/concentrations, specifics you need to 
know to replicate the experiment in practice.

- If more published procedures were annotated with patterns, and software 
existed to add, show, or search via pattern concepts would you find it useful
for either - adding missing context for procedures you are less familiar with,
or for searching the literature for examples and procedures you want to carry 
out?

- Do you think the knowledge and concepts that we surface with patterns would
help you perform experiments at the bench?
