Overall workshop evaluation
===========================

At the end of the workshop we need to collect anecdotal evidence for the 
overall efficiency, utility, level of difficulty/enjoyment of the pattern
mining process. 

- What was your motivation for attending the workshop?

- Were participants clear about the aims of the workshop, and their tasks?

- Write three adjectives that describe your experience with the workshop.

- Overall how difficult do you find the process?

- Were there any specific tasks you found difficult?

- Did you have enough time for the various activities? If not, where would you
prefer more time? How much extra time do you think would be useful?

- How could any tasks or the overall workshop be improved?

- Are there parts of the workshop you particularly enjoyed or found 
interesting?

- Did you learn or uncover anything about any of the procedures that surprised
you?

- Did you feel the workshop process effectively uncovered useful concepts for 
describing or organising laboratory procedures or knowledge?

- Would you be prepared to spend more time or attend additional workshops on 
these tasks?

- Can you think of other situations or the design of tools where the 
pattern concepts we uncovered today could be useful? How else would you like the
knowledge and concepts to be used?

- If lab patterns existed as a wikipedia type site, would you utilise 
them? Would you potentially comment or contribute in your areas of expertise?
If your contributions could be claimed as citeable outputs?
