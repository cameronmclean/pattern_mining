Useful resources while doing pattern things
===========================================

####For the 'whys'.
We often only have a vague notion of why we do certain things in the lab.
When abstracting important featues and thinking about 'why' it is useful to
go back to (sometime early) literature. Additional resources such as

[Protocol Online](http://www.protocol-online.org/)
[JOVE](http://www.jove.com/)
[Protocol Exchange](http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/)
[OpenWetware](http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page)
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)

can be useful, aside from _general googling_ and protocol specific journals
(eg. Nature Protocols, Cold Spring Harbor...)



####For icons and pictograms
Sketching likenesses that capture the meaning of an abstract concept can be
really tricky. Putting keywords into google images or Flikr can yield ideas for
things to sketch.

Other excellent resources include

[The Noun Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
[Openclipart](https://openclipart.org/)
