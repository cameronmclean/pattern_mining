More about patterns
===================

###Some further reading and background on what design patterns are.

First introduced in the domain of architecture and urban design, pattern languages were developed as a way of encapsulating expert knowledge in the form of structured descriptions of invariant solutions to recurring problems, to enable the generalisation and communication of design knowledge [1,2]. Patterns were developed in part to address what Alexander saw as a failure of modern architectural methods to create well designed forms that improve the human condition. Alexander sought to restore the intuitive and “timeless” way of building that had been lost when the knowledge required moved well beyond that of a single individual, and to overcome how the specialised and industrial (mass produced) modular components that designers were working with had severed the mutual understanding between builders, designers, and users. Design patterns were conceived as a kind of representation and shared language to uncover the invariants in examples of a good design, and offer a frame for analysis that shows all possible construction processes as a version of one deeper process for a given context [1]. 

The notion of a patterns grew from Alexander’s earlier work on design inspired by biologist D’Arcy Thompson [3], where he sought to understand how specific forms or configurations as solutions to a problem are shaped by external forces in the environment [4]. Once these important forces and interactions are understood, one can then generalise over specific forms and environments to create abstracted reusable solutions for similar cases. In his original works, Alexander defines patterns rather informally and multiple times, and variously describes them as
>“…a three part rule, which expresses a relation between a certain context, a problem, and a solution” 

and

>“each solution is stated in a way that gives it the essential fields of relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way - so that you can solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place where you are making it.” 

Additionally, Alexander states

>“As an element in the world, each pattern is a relationship between a certain context, a certain system of forces which occurs repeatedly in that context, and a certain spacial configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves. As an element of language, a pattern is an instruction, which shows how this spacial configuration can be used, over and over again, to resolve the given system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant. The pattern is, at the same time a thing, which happens in the world, and the rule which tells us how to create that thing, and when we must create it.”

It remains difficult to briefly summarise design patterns, and a deeper appreciation for what patterns are and aim to do is hard to convey without reading all of Alexanders original works or via direct experience with the practical use and generation of design patterns. However, a further introduction to Alexanders work including some relationships to object-orientated design is given by [5]. Kohls thesis [6] further extends and discusses some of the theoretical aspects of design patterns, and a comprehensive critical review of design patterns from the domain of human-computer interaction (HCI) is given by Dearden and Finlay [7].
