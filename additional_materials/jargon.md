####Design Pattern
An emprically proven solution to a recurring problem that occurs in a 
particular contex. Patterns are stated in general terms, that allow the 
specifics of the solution to be tailored in invididual instances.

####Force
The problem is an interrelated network of forces. Forces are the entities and 
constraints that must be balanced by the solution - they interact and are 
often in conflict. Makeing the forces explicit is at the heart of a pattern.
If we understand the forces, we understand the problem, and the rationale for
the solution.


####Context
The contex specifies the initial configuration of the system. It tells us where
the pattern will apply, and the circumstances under which the problem is a 
problem.


####Problem
States the essence of the generic problem, which leads us to the underlying 
forces. The problem tells us what needs to be solved - it is often expressed as
a loosely dependent clause. (e.g. if, while, because, unless...)


####Solution
A description that tells us how to resolve the forces that create the problem.
May consist of static relationships or dynamic rules that enable us to generate
something concrete.
