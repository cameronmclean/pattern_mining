Things to incorporate/update
===================

Patterns capture the "hidden strucutre" at a suitably general level //Khols, panke
Patterns are all about practice

We can only observe instances, not the generalised forms and their causes for their form //plato?

We write patterns to help other practitioners

Convention and norms are usually implicily agreeed upon in communiites of practice - design patterns make these categories explicit

Design variables are interdependent. If we change this, what effect does it have on the rest of the design. In what way is this variable constrained, what does it iteract with...

How can I test the pattern? (Empirically)  

Strive to ensure each pattern could conceivable used alone (break large protocol into sub sections/goals)

Name patterns by task, problem they solve. eg In vivo Live Imaging (not Photons alive) - helps user find pattern by task, and use in conversation.

Pattern audience - the level of detail and meaning of the terms should make sense to practitioners at the bench. (clear target audience)

Apply instructions/form design knowledge to pattern templates

Starting materials - bring in lab protocols with wich you have experience and modification/trouble shooting , or lab book where a protocol has been developed or reused. Explain why these are the starting point.

We want to be able to filter protocols by experience, and salient features, for a given context

Patterns are transformational - consider how implementations vary and evolve with time - capture the changes, and name the forces responsible for the change. 

Particaptory workflow analysis findings - teh speal is hte motivation and guidance for participating, and the kind of knowlege we want to capture...

Capture the context and rationale for design decisions.. these refelct expert thinking and are the potential proto-patterns.
